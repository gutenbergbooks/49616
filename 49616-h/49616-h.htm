<h2>Foreword</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THIS book has a purpose beyond that of mere
amusement. Its aim is to aid parents in furnishing
not only entertainment but profitable
employment as well, for their little ones—profitable,
in that work under the guise of play, makes for character.
The value of the things made is not in their finish,
but in the training which they afford—a value ethical
rather than intrinsic.</p>

<p>Children throw aside as uninteresting the finished
toys from the shops when they have once learned to make
playthings for themselves. To an imaginative child the
possibilities of green things growing, of other materials
provided by the changing seasons, and of the apparently
useless trifles to be found in any home, are endless, and far
surpass in permanent interest the realm of magic. In
giving tangible form to the creatures imagined, thought is
ripened into action and childhood’s natural desire for expressed
imagery satisfied.</p>

<p>In making use of these apparently inappropriate
materials in the construction of their own toys resourcefulness
is engendered, practical intelligence stimulated, the
inventive faculty cultivated, sympathetic acquaintance with
nature broadened, and manual dexterity increased—all of
which will later in life prove of inestimable value.</p>

<p>Then, too, such employment strengthens, or in some
instances, creates the ability to get pure enjoyment out
of the near at hand little things, which makes for permanent
happiness.</p>

<p>The whole nature of a child cries out for self activity.
Producing by his own efforts something that satisfies his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
own needs gives him the keenest possible pleasure, and
puts into him that energy which results in love of work.</p>

<p>There is no more interesting study for grown ups than
that of children at play with dolls and animals of their own
making. The more imaginative children prefer the flower
dolls which fade or die quickly and then go to take their
places in the sky to which they give the beautiful colors
on sunset evenings. Others, natural little gad-a-bouts,
always play “come to see,” while in some practical little
souls the spirit of motherhood is so strong that, to them,
every doll is a baby doll, and everything they play with,
from a clothes-pin to a poker, must be mothered—sung
to and cared for, petted and rocked.</p>

<p>Boys, with their more belligerent tastes, prefer to
make Indians and soldiers out of the same materials that
their sisters would convert into the most peaceful of citizens.
Those in whom the sense of humor is strong make
every face a comic one, while others put into the faces
drawn by them the demure, trivial, or rugged features and
expressions harmonizing with their ideas.</p>

<p>An effort has been made to furnish in these pages
suggestions for all sorts and conditions of children. The
songs and jingles are for those who like to make rhymes,
or to sing about everything that they do.</p>

<p>Only a few of the dolls and animals children can make
for themselves have been suggested. The possibilities of
the subject are by no means exhausted.</p>

<h2>Lady Hollyhock and Her Daughter</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="201" height="198" alt="toothpick dolls: tomato body and head on taller one with face on top tomato; smaller one has just a head" />
</div>

<p>Hollyhock Place was as beautiful a
spot as children ever had for a home.
Hollyhocks were blooming everywhere.
All about the house and along the lane
leading to it were great stalks bearing
satiny blossoms of all shades, from delicate
shell pink to the deepest, richest
red. Besides, there were countless
white and golden yellow ones.</p>

<p>When the little Wests came to live
there it seemed like fairy land to them. All their lives
they had lived in the city with its severe looking houses
and hard brick and stone pavements. There their playthings,
even, were made of wood and china and tin—all
ready made and finished.</p>

<p>Here everything was so different. There were flowers
and vines everywhere about their cottage home, shading
the windows and trailing over the fences. In the garden
at the back were beds of tender radishes and rows of tomatoes,
cabbages, potatoes, corn and other vegetables, while
over the fence grew vines bearing green and yellow gourds.</p>

<p>In the city the children had never seen these things
growing; here they could not only see them, but could help
them to grow, by watering them and stirring up the ground
about their roots. And afterwards, they could have them
for their very own. It was just the place to be perfectly
happy in.</p>

<p>Cousin Charlotte was to live with them. She was
fifteen and knew how to do many things to help children
enjoy themselves. The little Wests thought it was because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
she had always lived in the beautiful country. Perhaps it
was.</p>

<p>She knew how to make the most wonderful dolls out
of almost anything and could make rhymes and stories
about them. The first doll she made for them Eugenie
had named Lady Hollyhock. Eugenie had always liked
stories of lords and ladies and knights and other great folk
so the others were not at all surprised that their new visitor
was a Lady.</p>

<p>A most wonderful lady she was with the daintiest of
satiny gowns of the most beautiful shade of pink. In her
hair—or on her head—she wore a bow of green, while round
her neck was a great pointed green collar such as Queen
Elizabeth might have envied. The pink and green were
wonderfully becoming, for, being a lady of high degree
and having excellent taste, she was careful in choosing
colors which not only harmonized with each other, but
with her complexion.</p>

<p>Lady Hollyhock’s complexion was a marvel—different
from anything the children had ever seen in that line,—being
a peculiar light shade of green. This was not to be
wondered at though, when you know that Lady Hollyhock’s
head was nothing but a green tomato, her body
another, the green bow in her hair the stem and calyx of
the tomato, and her collar the fuzzy double calyx of a
hollyhock. Her gown—waist, sleeves and skirt—was of
the beautiful flower cups of hollyhocks tied in at the waist
by a long blade of grass.</p>

<p>Her piercing black eyes were glass headed pins, her
nose a bit of a match, and her pearly teeth white headed
pins. Tooth picks served for neck, arms and legs. Of
these last it took three to support so great a personage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The daughter of this noble lady looked much like her
mother though she was dressed somewhat differently. The
face was the same but the cap and gown were just a little
different. There was no sash about the waist of the
daughter—her gown hung loose from the shoulders making
her look younger. Having but one leg, this strange child
was always compelled to stand with that in a slice of potato
to keep from tumbling over.</p>

<p>After a time other members of the family joined
these two—some wore gowns of red, some of white, and
some of yellow, but none were more charming than the
first Lady Hollyhock and her daughter.</p>

<h2>The Cucumbers</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="184" height="198" alt="Cucumber in a dress with a face and a little one wiht a face and no clothes" />
</div>

<p>During the summer and the winter
following many friends visited with Lady
Hollyhock and her family.</p>

<p>From Cucumber Hill came a most
dignified Englishman. At a glance one
knew him to be English for he wore a
single eyeglass. A large brass headed
furniture tack occupied the place of one
eye while the other was filled by a small
black carpet tack. Though a trifle stiff
in his manners, this gentleman always wore an agreeable
smile.</p>

<p>The lady who came with him could not be called beautiful.
Her neck was too thick for that, but she smiled so
pleasantly and wore such a becoming gown that one hardly
noticed her neck. This gown was a loose flowing one of
white. With her rather sallow, bumpy, green skin she
could not have worn colors.</p>

<p>And the children from Cucumber Hill were much like
their elders—a little stiff and awkward but so cheerful that
they were always welcome.</p>

<p>After their visit, the members of this happy family
were usually caught and devoured by Florence, Tom and
Bunnie who played “Bear” sometimes to please Tom.</p>

<p>Like little Russians the children ate their cucumbers
with the skins on, just as they would eat apples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h2>Radishes and Corn</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="161" height="402" alt="black and white drawing of radish wrapped in leaves with a face and toothpick arms" />
</div>

<p>The beautiful red radishes from the
garden made the most charming of babies,
with their leaves turned down for clothes
and tied around with blades of grass. These
and the corn babies were Florence’s favorites.</p>

<p>When the tender roasting ears were
brought in from the garden the children all
agreed that they were such dainty babies,
just as they were, that it would spoil them
to change them in any way.</p>

<p>All they needed to do was just to open
the green husk a little and there lay the
most beautiful creamy white Corn Baby
wrapped in the daintiest of silken garments.</p>

<p>Florence hugged the Corn Baby close in
her arms and as she rocked it to sleep sang
to it a soft crooning little lullaby which she
and the others had made up. Charlotte—and
Mamma, too, had helped them a little
with both the tune and words. As Florence
sang to the baby in her arms the others joined her, singing
softly always, and letting the song fade away almost to a
whisper at the end that the baby might not miss the music
when it was heard no more.</p>

<p>Then the Corn Baby was tenderly laid in a cradle
Tom had made by gluing two semi-circles of wood for rockers
to a pasteboard spool box. The wooden circle which he
had cut in two had once had a bolt of ribbon wrapped
around it in a store.</p>

<p>Pansy dolls were made in several
ways—and pansy verses with them. Of
these dolls the easiest to make were the
paper ones, folded and cut as all children
cut rows of doll dresses. Then a small
hole was cut in the top of each dress, and
the pansy stem put into it. Without
further work there stood a pansy lady
with a paper body and blossom head.</p>

<p>Other pansy dolls were made by
covering tiny pill bottles with grass
blades, or leaves, putting one end of each
leaf in the bottle, turning them all down, and tying them
in place with a grass blade sash. When the bottle was
filled with water and a pansy put into it, the children had
a pansy lady who would live a day or two.</p>

<h2>Poppy Maids</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">GREAT beds of poppies grew at the end of the cottage
at Hollyhock Place. To make poppy blossoms
into dolls is the easiest thing in the world. All
you have to do is to turn down the soft, silky
petals, tie a blade of grass round them, and there you have
a poppy maid, all finished and growing on a stem—a real
flower fairy. There is a small green seed pod inside, you
know, and that is the poppy maid’s head.</p>

<p>After making a number of these without breaking
their stems the children often laid a cucumber, or radish
baby in the poppy bed and sang to it a soothing lullaby—one
they had made up themselves. Perhaps they had a
little help—I cannot say as to that.</p>

<p>Poppies are the flowers that bring sleep you know.</p>

<p>Before long, the poppy maids would fade away and
others would take their places. The dead ones were quietly
buried near their friends, and soon after, at sunset, their
colors were seen in the sky, as were those of many dead and
gone, hollyhock and morning-glory ladies. None of these
ever lived to be very old.</p>

<h2>Acorn and Burdock Eskimos</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ALONG the orchard fence grew great broad leaved
burdocks crowned with purplish pink tipped
burs, which early in the season were made into
all sorts of useful and beautiful objects—baskets,
hanging baskets, cradles, sofas, chairs, tables and many
other things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="307" height="182" alt="fence corner with two bushes in front" />
</div>

<p>In autumn, when the large acorns with fringed cups
began to fall, the children gathered them and made them
into Eskimos. One acorn was used for the body, and one
for the head, with the point on the end for a nose. Twigs
of the oak served for arms and legs.</p>

<p>The warmest of fur overcoats was made of the ripened
burdock burs, while the furry fringed cup of the acorn made
a cap that would have delighted the heart of any Eskimo.</p>

<p>Then Eskimo huts or igloos were made of the burs or
“furs” as the children called them. Of course every one
knows that real igloos are made of blocks of ice or snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
not of fur, but ice was not to be had at that season of the
year and would not have been comfortable to work with
anyway.</p>

<p>As the bur Eskimo was in immediate need of a home
the little Wests made him the very best one they could of
the materials at hand. A very neat round hut was made
of burs and that it might appear more real, both it and
the ground were covered with cotton snow, making a real
arctic landscape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you make animals as well as
people out of fruits and vegetables, children?”
said papa one day.</p>

<p>Why hadn’t they to be sure? They had
never thought of such a thing, but when they did it was
not long before the place was stocked with all sorts of strange
animals.</p>

<p>The first piece of vegetable live stock the little Wests
owned was a lemon pig which Uncle John made for them
from a lemon, two white headed pins, and four matches.</p>

<p>With a knife a small gash was cut for a mouth; then
ears were cut from the skin. These were left fastened to
the lemon at the front edge.</p>

<p>Then pigs must have pens! So pens naturally followed—pens
of corn cobs put together in rail fence fashion.</p>

<p>Later in the season there were acorn pigs in pens made
of sticks and straws.</p>

<h2>Burdock Leaves and Clothes-Pins</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="50" height="203" alt="clothespeg" />
</div>

<p>Burdock leaves as well as the burs were used by the
children in their plays. Hats and shawls were made of
them—but best of all were the burdock leaf
wigwams.</p>

<p>To make these twigs or tent poles were stuck
in the ground and burdock leaves folded round
them in tent fashion. The points of the leaves
were torn off to make them the right shape.</p>

<p>Then there had to be Indians to live in the
wigwams and these were made of clothes-pins.
Nothing could be easier to make than a clothes-pin
Indian.</p>

<p>First the features are marked out on the head
of the pin, then a band of paper pasted round the
top and a feather stuck in at the back for a war-bonnet;
and a square of stiff paper folded around the clothes-pin,
for a blanket, and the Indian is finished.</p>

<p>The little Wests made whole villages of burdock wigwams
with clothes-pin braves standing guard at the doors.</p>

<p>Tom always liked stories of enchantment, so he made
up one about these wooden Indians.</p>

<h2>The Clothes-Pin Tribe</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">JOURNEYING across the country a lone traveler
chanced upon an Indian village. Such Indians as
he saw there were unknown to him, and neither
did he know that Indians of any kind dwelt in
that part of the land.</p>

<p>Strange to him, too, were the wigwams, or teepees,
of the unknown tribe. All of the wigwams with which
he was familiar were covered with either blankets or skins.
These were of the leaves of the burdock and much smaller
than any he had ever seen—fit only for the homes of a
pigmy tribe—and such it proved to be.</p>

<p>Guarding every wigwam stood an Indian, while others
were scattered about the encampment.</p>

<p>As the traveler gazed on the scene before him, his astonishment
grew when he saw that not a figure moved. Every
man stood up straight and silent.</p>

<p>Inquiring of a passer-by, one who seemed acquainted
with the regions round about, the traveler asked the meaning
of what he saw, and learned that the pigmy tribe was
ruled by a giant, who years ago had departed for a great
city where he hoped to bargain with the people for the sale
of the tobacco which his tribe produced. The sample he
carried was in the form of a package of cigars, bound about
by a strip of twisted tobacco leaves.</p>

<p>For the crime of tempting people to make use of that
which would harm them the giant Indian and his pigmy
tribe had had a spell cast over them, which turned them
to wood, took away their speech, and rendered them motionless.</p>

<p>From the time when the spell came over them no Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>in all the tribe had so much as winked an eye. And all
would remain as they were till the spell was broken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;">

<div class="caption">THE CLOTHES-PIN TRIBE</div>
</div>

<p>All stood just as they did at the moment when the
enchantment fell upon them—the sentinels stock still at
the doors of their tents, and the others stiff and straight
in the places where that awful moment had found them;
the giant chief stood just as he did on that day, ever holding
out the package of cigars bound about by the twisted band
of tobacco leaves.</p>

<p>When some paleface should take from the hand of
the giant Indian the cigars which he offered, the spell would
be broken, but to this day no such paleface had come.</p>

<p>This was the story Tom told Grandpa, the lone traveler,
when asked about his clothes-pin Indian village with its
burdock wigwams. And Grandpa said that it was no doubt
true, for he, himself, had seen the giant Indian chief standing,
wooden and silent, on a city street, offering cigars to
every passer-by.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Thanksgiving season brought to mind the other
early settlers of America, and these, too, were represented
by clothes-pin men and women, while the rude cabins of
our forefathers were represented by corn cob cabins chinked
with mud.</p>

<p>John Alden in his tall Pilgrim hat and Priscilla in her
gown of gray and kerchief of white were favorite figures
in these early history plays of the West children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h2>An Irish (Potato) Woman and Her Family</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">SOME of the jolliest visitors were from the potato
patch. They were Irish, of course, and every
one knows how much fun there is in all Irish
people. There was not a serious looking one in
the whole family.</p>

<p>The mother had a most peculiar face, round and plump
and happy, but deformed. Though she had more than
the usual number of eyes, they were not located so she
could use them as <i>eyes</i>.</p>

<p>One was on her cheek just where others sometimes
have dimples, so she used that for a dimple. Another was
on her forehead, and another just where an eye should
have been for seeing purposes. But, sad to tell, this one
had a sprout in it, and a sprout in the eye would ruin any
one’s sight.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the little Wests, the Irish woman
might have been blind all her life. With an ordinary lead
pencil an operation was performed on her face which gave
her a beautiful round eye just opposite the afflicted one.</p>

<p>This so pleased her that a broad smile spread over
her face—a smile that she wore as long as she lived—and
that was reflected in the faces of all of her family.</p>

<p>If you had asked her how it happened that they were
always smiling, she would have said, “Sure, smiles are
catching, just like measles.” When one in a family has
them, they all do. Yes, they’re just as catching as measles,
and much pleasanter to have.</p>

<p>Other potatoes were made up into gay Irish maidens,
with early rose complexions, and into Irish men, with sun-browned
faces, and into sturdy Irish children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>These were able to stand up very nicely too, having
good substantial Irish (potato) feet.</p>

<p>And who ever heard of an Irish family without a pig?
And were not potatoes the most natural things in the world
to make pigs of?</p>

<p>Nothing could have been easier to make. A long
potato was the body, four matches the legs, two pins the
eyes, while a curled dandelion stem made the most natural
pig tail imaginable.</p>

<h2>Creatures of Clay</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HAVE you ever made men and animals of mud?
You can do almost anything with it when it
is just soft enough. If it is too dry it is
sure to crack. Clay is best, but any kind of
mud will do.</p>

<p>The little Wests spent hours and hours making people
and villages of clay—for there was a most delightfully damp
bank by the brookside, where the clay seemed made for
young artists.</p>

<p>After modeling a few men, the children began to
notice just how large a head ought to be, for a certain sized
body, and how far down the arms ought to reach, and
whether the legs were longer or shorter than the arms.</p>

<p>At first, though, they made some funny looking
creatures. Lady Hollyhock must have smiled more than
ever when she saw two of them coming. Or maybe she
was frightened.</p>

<p>One of them was a savage with excelsior hair standing
out all over his head. The only clothing he wore was a
skirt of leaves fastened about his clumsy waist.</p>

<p>His companion was a dwarf negro made by Ted, a
larger playmate of the West children. Ted never would
be serious. He told the children that the ugly dwarf had
spoiled his looks by looking and listening too much. His
looks certainly had been spoiled in some way.</p>

<p>Cousin Charlotte made a rhyme about him, which
seemed to explain his appearance pretty well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Corn Husk Lady</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 164px;">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="164" height="321" alt="corn husk" />
</div>

<p>Through the mail one day the little
Wests received a box bearing a Nebraska
post mark. On opening it they saw the
queerest doll imaginable, all neatly packed
in crushed tissue paper.</p>

<p>This was a lady doll made entirely of
corn husks and corn silk. The silk was for
hair, of course, and very real looking hair
it made. A bunch of the thinner, softer
husks had been tied together for the head
and body; a flat piece was laid over the
place where the face was to be, and a
string drawn tightly around it about an
inch from the top making a very neat,
shapely head and neck. Water color
paints were used to make the clear blue
eyes, rosy cheeks, and other features. Curly brown corn
silk was next fastened on for hair, and t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>wo rather stiff
rolls of husks served for arms.</p>

<p>Then the lady was dressed in the most elaborate garments.
She wore a gathered waist, large sleeves, and a
very full skirt. On her head was a bonnet, wonderful to
behold. Like her gown and parasol, it, too, was made
entirely of corn husks.</p>

<p>A letter that came with the doll said that it had been
made by a little crippled girl living on a Nebraska farm
and who had made the husk dolls for amusement at first,
but that since she had learned to make them so well many
of her dolls had been sold. What she had begun for mere
pleasure was now a source of profit to her.</p>

<p>The letter said, also, that in making her dolls this little
girl always soaked the husks to soften them and to keep
them from tearing while the dolls were being made.</p>

<p>In looking about for a name for the new visitor the
children decided upon “Cornelia” as the name best suited
to one of her nature and general makeup.</p>

<p>When Papa was asked to suggest a last name for the
young lady from Nebraska he said he thought “Shucks”
would probably be as appropriate as any other, so Cornelia
Shucks she was called.</p>

<p>On the very day the young lady arrived the children
hunted up some nice clean corn husks and put them to soak
in warm water. There were thin white pieces which came
next to the corn, and butter colored strips, and deep brown
ones—variety enough for any doll’s wardrobe. After an
hour or two of soaking, the husks were taken from the water
and wiped as dry as possible and then they were ready.</p>

<p>After much examination of the fair Cornelia’s form
and style of dress the little Wests were able to make quite
respectable looking husk dolls. Of course, the first ones
were a trifle clumsy, but after a while these children were
able to make and dress lady dolls as fine as Cornelia Shucks
herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

endure the hardest usage.</p>

dearer to the heart of its owner than the corn cob baby.</p>

<p>Baby Bunnie gave her corn cob child a little more
style than such babies usually have, by wrapping it about
as babies are sometimes wrapped in foreign countries.</p>

<p>Red cobs were made into Indian babies, and bound
into bark cradles, and hung up in the trees, like real

<h2>The Peanut Man</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Peanut Chinese man was made of eight peanuts—one
for the head, one for the body, one for
each arm and two for each leg. All had double
kernels, except the one forming the head.</p>

<p>These peanuts were fastened together by heavy thread.
The needle was run crosswise through the end of one nut;
then through the end of the nut joining it, and the thread
tied in a hard knot.</p>

<p>The face was drawn with a pen and ink. The back
of the head and bottoms of the feet were solidly inked for
hair and shoes and the cue was of braided black silk
thread, sewed to the top of the head. Over the place where
the cue was fastened, a disk of stiff paper was glued for
a hat.</p>

<p>When crinkled tissue paper was gathered around the
neck and arms to form a loose jacket and around the legs
for wide trousers, the Peanut Chinese man was complete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Peanut Chinese Woman</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Peanut Chinese woman was not dressed like a
real Chinese woman. Living in America, she
was beginning to like skirt-like gowns better than
the baggy trousers of her own people. Her sleeves,
too, had just a little of the American look.</p>

<p>But when it came to dressing her hair the real Chinese
style suited her best. The heavy black silky loops were
caught up and held in place by long pins such as she had
used in her native land.</p>

<p>Her garments, like those of the Peanut Chinese man,
were of crinkled tissue paper, though the little Wests pretended
they were of silk.</p>

<p>They wanted these dolls to have silk clothing like real
Chinese people, but as they did not have the goods, they
just imagined that the paper was silk and were happy in
the make-believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Acorn Family</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the autumn when the acorns began to fall the
children found no end of amusement in making
them up into all sorts of people and animals.</p>

<p>Some were converted into soldiers—Japanese,
with blue kimonos and Russians with long fur overcoats—and
often they were lined up for battle. Ruthlessly the
children shot them down with bean shooters. Since their
sympathies were with the Japs, of course the Russians suffered
most, yet there were losses on both sides.</p>

<p>While the brown of the acorns suggested Japs and
Filipenos, it was equally suggestive of our own negro
people, so numbers of these were made with their blue
checked gowns and red bandanas.</p>

<p>Then there were just ordinary acorn men and women,
with acorn heads on toothpick necks, and bodies of twisted
paper.</p>

<p>One attractive pair was dressed in corn-colored crinkled
tissue paper. A round disk of the paper was pasted to the
top of the head of each for the brim of a hat, and the cup
of the acorn pasted over that for a crown. No prettier
doll hats could be imagined.</p>

<p>The shoes these little people wore were of ink.</p>

<p>Everything the acorn family had was made, like themselves,
of acorns. Their cups and saucers, their plates, their
baskets, their tops, and their pigs, even, were of acorns.</p>

<p>Tom enjoyed the tops most. These were made by
running slender toothpicks, or shoepegs, about halfway
through the acorns which spun on their own points. Games
were often played with these tops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>When any one wanted to know which army would be
victorious in battle two tops were set spinning on a plate
and each named for an opposing army. The one falling
over first was defeated, of course. Sometimes one spun
itself off the plate. That meant a retreat.</p>

<p>Disks of bright colored paper were often placed above
the top on the toothpick or shoepeg. When red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, and violet were used and all the tops
set spinning at the same time, this meant that a rainbow
had gone to pieces and each color was doing its best to
get back into its proper place.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE members of the
Haw family were
not very different
from those of the
Acorn family. Why should
they be? They had lived
side by side in the same
wood all their
lives, and had
grown up together
under the same circumstances.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/i_081b.jpg" width="105" height="173" alt="a hawthorn person" />

<p>Their complexions were different, to be
sure, but aside from this and the difference
in the shape of their heads, they were
built on exactly the same lines—round
bodies, slender arms and
legs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/i_081c.jpg" width="104" height="171" alt="Hawthorne person looking up" />

<p>Like the Acorn family some had perfectly
stiff limbs, while others were provided
with joints. The first
were supposed to
have rheumatism.</p>

<p>The only wonder
is that they
did not all have it,
going about as they
did, without any
clothes, in all sorts
of weather.</p>

</div>

<p>The little Wests each fancied a different
style of doll. Eugenie liked dressed up visiting
dolls, Florence played mother to baby dolls in
long dresses, Tom liked what he called “funny
fellows” and Indians, while baby Bunnie
always insisted on her children keeping house.</p>

<p>Tom’s favorites, the funny fellows, came
from the squash patch and gourd vines. It
was not necessary to even dress these. All
one had to do was to dip a match in ink and
mark out faces on them.</p>

<p>These faces could be made either sunny and cheerful
or sour and sad by changing the directions of the lines.
Lines turning upward made the happy faces and those
turning downward made the troubled ones.</p>

<p>The oval yellow gourds were made into fat men and
Humpty Dumpties. These Tom used to make run races
with each other by rolling them down hill. Which do you
think always beat, the fattest and largest, or the smaller
ones?</p>

<h2>Gourd Men</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">NONE of the Gourd men ever had the appearance of
being either sensible or well behaved. But one
ought not to expect sense and dignity from any
of their race, for, all over the world, those who
have neither are said to be as “green as a gourd.”</p>

<p>It was only the gourd babies who seemed to know
anything at all about behaving properly. Strange as it
may seem, the younger members of this awkward family
were as sweet and quiet as any babies in the whole vegetable
kingdom.</p>

<p>Some of these gourd children were made by using the
large part for a head and putting a deep frill about the neck
for a gown. This was held in place by a pin run through
both gown and baby.</p>

<p>Others were made by using the slender part for a head
and putting the same kind of a frill about the neck for a
dress. The last kind could sit up as well as any real child.</p>

<p>It was the easiest thing in the world to make rhymes
about these dolls—indeed the rhymes seemed to almost
make themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

caps on them under their bonnets, and bringing
the cloth down and tying it at the neck with a string, this
extended cap made a very good foundation for a body.</p>

<p>It was found that bonnets and long capes were the
most becoming garments for these dolls, as they seemed to
harmonize best with the caps.</p>

<p>Since Nuns and Nurses both dress in this way, the
greater number of the Hickory-nut family turned out to
be Nuns and Nurses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Kelp Maiden</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN August Uncle John came all the way from California
to make a visit at Hollyhock Place. The little Wests
never tired of hearing him tell of the wonderful
things that grew in that western land—of trees higher
than church spires—of sea-gulls and pelicans—and of the
queer California Woodpecker that bores holes in the
trunks of dead trees and pounds an acorn into each hole
for future use.</p>

<p>As the family sat out under the trees this jolly old
uncle of theirs seemed to take as much interest in the funny
home-made dolls as the children themselves did. It was
he who showed them how to make the great fat-faced
Humpty Dumpties out of the oval yellow “darning
gourds” as Mamma called them.</p>

<p>And what fun they had making jingles—Uncle John
and the little Wests. Songs he called them, and they were,
too, for a tune always came with the words when he made
them.</p>

<p>When their uncle left to go back to his California home
the children missed him greatly and watched eagerly for
the letter he promised them when he reached home. Two
whole weeks passed before the letter arrived. When it
came there was a small package with it.</p>

<p>What was in the package? There is no need to tell,
the letter will explain. Here is the letter which made the
children laugh as much as if Uncle John himself had been
there telling them what he had written. Charlotte played
and sang the song for them till they all learned it. But as
I said, here is the letter:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">San Diego, Calif.</span>,</span><br />
September 1st, 1906.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Nieces and Nephew</span>:—</p>

<div class="right">
What do you think?<br />
</div>

<div class="unindent2">Your Uncle John is getting the doll habit! Since I visited
you half the things I see turn into dolls as I look at them,
and I immediately begin to make songs or jingles about
them just as you do. As I sit at the table the dishes even,
take doll form in my mind. The plates seem to have great
moon faces, while the sugar bowl seems to stand with shoulders
thrown up and arms akimbo like an awkward china
washerwoman. The knives, forks and spoons are almost
human with their shining faces.</div>

<p>This morning as I passed a bake-shop and glanced in
at the window, the cakes and buns seemed to laugh and
wink at me with the fat faces of their bakers.</p>

<p>The doll I send you today was made of kelp by a little
California girl. Kelp is a heavy leathery sort of sea-weed
that washes ashore about here. There are great beds of
it off the coast of California. It grows so thickly that it
gives the water a brown appearance and the long leathery
leaves are strong enough to bear up pelicans and other sea-birds
that one often sees apparently standing on the water.
Visitors to California often take home beautiful baskets and
other things woven from strips of this strong leathery weed,
which is brown on the outside and creamy white inside.</p>

<p>This little kelp maiden I got for you several days ago
and as I have watched her standing on the mantel-piece
with that dissatisfied look on her face, she seemed to sing
this song to me, and as I listened I seemed to hear the plash
and feel the rolling of the waves which used to rock her to
sleep out on the kelp beds at sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>I wonder if it will seem the same to you? I know
she will be a warning to you against discontent which is
sure to spoil the pleasure of anyone if it is allowed to get
into his life.</p>

<p>I am hoping that the little kelp maid may grow cheerful
through associating with Lady Hollyhock and her friends.
They all have happy faces as I remember them—as happy
as those of three cheery little nieces and a jolly little
nephew of</p>

<h2>Morning-Glory Ladies</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">MORNING-GLORY ladies were made by slipping
a flower cup upside down over the stem of a
seed pod, leaving the pod for a head. Morning-glory
ladies always died young. Indeed, they
hardly lived at all.</p>

<p>The spirits of these lost flower children were not only
seen in the sunset skies but in the rainbow, too. And when
the little Wests saw the great, beautiful bow in the sky,
they always repeated the words of old Nokomis to Hiawatha:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE children planted pumpkin seeds early in the
season and hoed and cared for the vines themselves,
that they might have their own pumpkins
for Hallowe’en, and what fun they had with
them! And how delightfully scarey they were, when
made into Jack O’Lanterns! Some one said they were
pumpkin ghosts.</p>

<p>Two dreadful ones were placed on the gate posts to
frighten Papa when he came home after dark. He guessed
right away who had put them there.</p>

<p>Others were carried about on poles with sheets hanging
about them, in solemn procession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

terrible pain in his stomach.</p>

<p>The verses Cousin Charlotte and the others made about

<h2>Rastus Prune</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">RASTUS was a peculiar looking negro, with wrinkled
face and goggle eyes.</p>

<p>Paper teeth with a red lip line running
around them were fitted into a wrinkle of his
prune face and fastened by a touch of mucilage. His
paper eyes were fastened on in the same way.</p>

<p>With a light paper vest neatly fitted over his prune
body and a paper collar round his peg neck he was as neat
a colored gentleman as could be found anywhere.</p>

<p>Then his chamois-skin suit with hat to match, gave
him such style as any one might be pleased to copy.</p>

<p>His checked trousers were his special pride, for they
never bagged at the knees or got out of shape in any way.
On this account he was perfectly satisfied to be a peg-leg.</p>

<p>His feet, though, gave him some trouble. They were
always getting out of shape. Being made of raisins, an
ordinary step was likely to make them swing round and
look as though they would prefer to take him the other way.</p>

<p>But Rastus smiled on, thinking, no doubt, that this
apparent deformity would prove a great convenience when
it came to dancing a “backstep.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h2>Dinah Prune</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">DINAH, the mother of Rastus, was just a plain
sensible colored woman, wearing a dark gown,
and a bandana head dress.</p>

<p>Like most colored women of her age, she
always wore a neat kerchief folded across her breast, and
a large apron to protect her gown.</p>

<p>Though she was no beauty, she was good. All who
knew her liked her, and the same might be said of her son.</p>

<p>Like him, she was made of prunes and toothpicks, and
stood on raisin feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h2>Pipe Dolls</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="173" height="343" alt="pipe" />
</div>

<p>Not all the dolls made by these children
were of fruits, flowers and vegetables. In
fact it was a poor scrap that they could not
make into a satisfactory plaything. And
not only the little Wests enjoyed them but
Mamma was just as much interested in the
making as were the children themselves.</p>

<p>One evening a little party of friends
was gathered together at Hollyhock Place
and for amusement Mamma gave each a
clay pipe, a lead pencil, a square of white
and a square of colored tissue paper and
requested each guest to dress the pipe for
a doll.</p>

<p>To some this, at first, seemed impossible.
One or two gentlemen asked to be
excused, but when they saw the others meeting
with such success they, too, became
interested and went to work. Nearly all used needles and
thread, but a few were most successful with mucilage to
hold their materials together.</p>

<p>It was funny to see the different expressions on those
pipe faces. No two of them looked the least bit alike.</p>

<p>The minister’s wife did not use her colored paper at all,
but from the white she made a long baby dress with a big
bow in the back and a white cap with another big bow was
made to cover the head. This baby had the tiniest little
eyes, nose and mouth you could imagine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Another lady made a clown of her pipe, using orange
paper for his clown suit and pasting white circles all over it.
This was a neater clown than one ever seeks in a circus, for
he wore the freshest of white ruffles at his neck, wrists and
ankles. The bump at the bottom of the pipe made the
funniest of chin whiskers for this queer creature who could
not keep from laughing at himself—and no wonder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">A CLAY PIPE OLD LADY</div>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the ladies made her pipe into an old lady doll
with folded kerchief and great tall cap. In this one the
bump at the bottom of the pipe served as a nose—a large,
ill shaped one to be sure, but a very good nose for all that.</p>

<p>A very dignified gentleman who was present said he
always liked to see a lady wear a sun-bonnet, so he drew a
face inside of his pipe and made lines outside for “slats”
that used to be put in old fashioned sun-bonnets. A
woman who would wear a sun-bonnet would, of course,
wear an apron, so a large white apron was put on this doll.
Her face was a pretty one, but her hands were large and
clumsy, showing that she had done hard work in her day.</p>

<p>These last two dolls wore several full petticoats which
enabled them to stand up like real people.</p>

<p>There were a number of other good ones, but why tell
you about them, for I am sure you can make some just as
good as the best of these.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h2>Paper Dolls</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE paper dolls were more like real people than
any of the others. They were made by cutting
heads from colored picture cards or from magazines
and pasting them on cardboard bodies.
Then double dress patterns were folded and cut to slip over
the heads of the dolls, and on these patterns were pasted
gowns of tissue paper in all colors and styles.</p>

<p>The children were very particular about dressing their
dolls in good taste, for they knew that by making neat,
sensible doll clothes, they would learn how to dress themselves
tastefully when they grew older.</p>

<p>The little girl dolls wore either plain gingham dresses
with fresh white aprons, or simple white gowns. Their
hats were plain, without feathers or flowers, as little girls’
hats should be.</p>

<p>Lady dolls wore dresses that were more elaborate.
The colors in these always harmonized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h2>Handkerchief Dolls</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">NO collection of make-believe would be complete
without the handkerchief doll.</p>

<p>Surely she is a simple child, just an ordinary
handkerchief rolled from each side toward the
center, then the top turned down, and the corners pulled
out and tied around the body for arms, leaving a stuffy
little head at the top, and a long skirt at the bottom.</p>

<p>The handkerchief doll’s little brother is made to look
a trifle different from her, by having the lower corners of
the handkerchief, of which he is made, pulled out for feet.</p>

<p>Towel dolls are larger members of the same family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<h2>Pill-Box Dolls</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE of Baby Bunnie’s especial favorites was the
handkerchief doll made over a round pill box.
With a pencil a face was marked out on the box
and around this a handkerchief was folded three-cornerwise
and pinned under the chin.</p>

<p>On dress occasions this little one wore around her
neck a pretty fresh ribbon tied in a large bow with long
ends. Could a more dainty child be found anywhere?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Straw Indian</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">LADY HOLLYHOCK’S visitors differed greatly in
many ways. It was not only in looks that they
varied, but in their very natures. And strange
to say, many were different from what they
seemed.</p>

<p>Some who appeared bravest and strongest were the
weakest. For instance, who would have thought, to look
at the fierce appearing Straw Indian, in all the bravery
of war-bonnet and blanket, that he was one of the weakest
of them all?</p>

<p>It was not his fault, poor fellow. He really wanted
to be brave and strong. He showed that in both manner
and dress. But with his weak constitution, how could
he ever have gone into battle with the braves of his tribe?
It had always been impossible for him to stand up for himself,
even, without something to lean on.</p>

<p>He tried to make up for his natural weakness by dressing
and acting like a brave, but it was useless.</p>

<p>Exercise, which makes others grow strong, only made
the poor Straw Indian weaker, and while he was yet young
his constitution gave way and he was laid to rest by the
little Wests, who loved him in spite of his weakness, beside
others of his tribe.</p>

<p>After the manner of real Indians he was buried in a
sitting position, down in the orchard, near the clothes-pin
Indian village.</p>

<p>However frail he may have been in life, now that the
friendly earth supported him, none sat straighter than the
lamented Straw Indian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Dried Peach Indian</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Dried Peach Indian was just as different as
could be from the Straw Indian. Being both
strong and brave, he went out and did great
deeds, as you can see by his war-bonnet.</p>

<p>If he had been just an ordinary Indian brave, he would
have had only two or three eagles’ feathers at the back of the
band encircling his head.</p>

<p>But as every feather in an Indian’s war-bonnet means
some great deed done, any one can see the Dried Peach
Indian had led a busy life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2>Pastry Creatures</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">BUT of all Lady Hollyhock’s visitors, the little
Wests enjoyed most those who came from the
kitchen.</p>

<p>When baking day came, Mamma always
allowed the children to have a little pastry dough to make
up into the forms they liked best.</p>

<p>Pie crust was fashioned into all sorts of animals as
well as into people. These kept their shape beautifully.</p>

<p>Doughnut creatures, though good to have, were likely
to lose their shapeliness as they grew in the fat. They
did not suffer long, however, for they were soon eaten.</p>

<p>The story of the Doughnut Man was always sung as
one of these odd creatures disappeared.</p>

<p>Sweetest of all were the Gingerbread Maids. It always
took a pan full of these favorites to satisfy the children.
Verses were made about these, too, and often repeated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Yarn Child</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE yarn child had a hard time in the world. You
would not think it to look at her, but she did.</p>

<p>The very first day of her life she was given
to a baby who was so fond of her that he bit her,
and tried to pull her to pieces; then squeezed and hugged
and picked at her till it was a wonder she ever lived through
it all—Lady Hollyhock never could have endured such
treatment.</p>

<p>But the yarn child did. Her main business in life was
to amuse that baby, and, no matter how she was treated,
her yarn eyes were just as wide open and her yarn smile
just as broad as if she had always had the best of treatment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<h2>Rag Dolls</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AT Lady Hollyhock’s all visitors were treated alike.
Those who came in rags were just as welcome
as any.</p>

<p>Here is one pair, Mr. and Mrs. Dry Goods,
who came all in rags even to their faces. Indeed, they
appeared so well that one hardly thought of their garb
until attention was called to it.</p>

<p>They were just as neat and clean as could be, though
every part of them, from bodies to bonnets, had come out
of the rag-bag.</p>

<p>These rag people were made by first taking a small
wad of cotton wool for the head of each and covering it
with thin brown silk drawn tightly together at the back,
where knots of black thread were made to look quite
like hair.</p>

<p>The features were drawn with a sharp pencil on each
brown face while a stitch of white thread between the lips
did very nicely for teeth. A small stitch of white was used
in each eye, also.</p>

<p>Tight rolls of cloth served for the bodies, arms, and legs.
When these were sewed securely together, the little rag
couple were ready to be dressed.</p>

<p>As real people in dressing put on stockings and shoes
first, these rag people did the same. The stockings they
wore were cut from worn-out black silk gloves and sewed
neatly up the back. The shoes and mittens were made
from old kid gloves and fastened on with a few stitches.</p>

<p>Then the rag couple were dressed quite like other dolls,
very neatly, of course, for the little Wests did everything
neatly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<h2>Rag Babies</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="93" height="284" alt="strip of rag" />
</div>

<p>Then there were the rag babies—I almost
said the little rag people—but that would not
have been true, for strange to say the babies
were larger than the older members of the family.</p>

<p>This does not seem so strange after all, when
one stops to think, for in the whole rag world,
everything grows smaller as it grows older.</p>

<p>Some of these were just ordinary white babies
while others belonged to the colored race. The Topsies
were made of brown cotton or silk, with faces
done in water colors, and hair of French knots.</p>

<p>But no matter what their color, or how they
were made, the rag babies probably got more
real love from their owners than any other dolls
in the whole collection.</p>

<p>Rag babies are made by folding a piece of paper lengthwise
and cutting the pattern of a half body free hand.
This will insure the two sides being alike.</p>

<p>After getting a good pattern, cut from muslin two
pieces just alike for front and back, sew them together and
stuff with cotton.</p>

<p>The features can be made with either water colors or
common ink thinned a little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<h2>Tissue-Paper Ladies</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">OTHER tissue-paper ladies were made by gluing
an upright strip of wood to the center of a horizontal
piece, like an inverted T, and wrapping
it with cotton for a foundation.</p>

<p>A ball of cotton was fastened to the top for a head,
then covered with white tissue paper on which a face was
drawn with a pencil.</p>

<p>These ladies wore loose, flowing gowns, long capes,
and large, comfortable bonnets tied under the chin.</p>

<p>Tissue-paper ladies of this kind could stand alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h2>Humpty-Dumpty</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HUMPTY-DUMPTY was made from an empty
egg shell. First, holes were carefully picked
in the shell and the egg blown out. Then the
face and cap were drawn in ink on the shell.</p>

<p>Wires covered with dark tissue paper were then put
through the holes and bent into shape for arms and legs.</p>

<p>If light-weight hair pins are used, two or three may
be twisted together for legs and spread at the ends to form
feet. These dolls can stand alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h2>Cinderella’s Coach</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 207px;">
<img src="images/i_153.jpg" width="207" height="249" alt="doll with crown" />
</div>

<p>“I wish a fairy godmother would
come and make a Cinderella’s coach
for us out of this squash,” said Baby
Bunnie one day.</p>

<p>“We can be our own fairy godmother,”
said little Florence, as she
set to work to make the wish come
true. Soon there stood before them a
wonderful coach made of that very
squash—drawn by handsome peanut
horses—and in it rode a beautiful
peanut Princess, while a little dark
raisin footman with toothpick arms
and legs rode at the back on a seat cut out for him.
A hairpin was the axle which held the pasteboard wheels
in place.</p>

<p>The Princess was to drive straight to Lady Hollyhock’s,
where the footman would assist her in leaving the carriage.</p>

<p>You, too, can be your own fairy godmother, and if you
wish to have a great ball, at which all of Lady Hollyhock’s
visitors may appear, not through the touch of a wand, but
through the touch of the hand—and all of them will be so
real that they will not fade away when the Princess goes.</p>

<p>Would it not be best, after all, for every one of us to
be our own fairy godmothers, so that when we want very
much to have anything happen we can set things going to
bring it about? Then the things wished for will not vanish
away at the stroke of a clock, but will be ours always.</p>
